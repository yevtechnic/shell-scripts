shell-scripts
=============

Personal shell scripts for various purposes that work personally.

`src/voicenotes`
----------------

The scripts in this directory are related to renaming files for lecture
recordings. It currently fits my workflow, manually renaming "outliers" that
dont fit into the predetermined schedule, but otherwise it renames all the
recordings into the proper course code and lecture/tutorial number based off of
the schedule in `.classes` and keeps track of numbers in `.count`.
